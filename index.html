			<p>There are 12 true species of foxes and they can be found on all continents around the globe.  The red fox, Vulpes vulpes, is the largest of the true foxes and the most abundant wild member of the Carnivora, being present across the entire Northern Hemisphere from the Arctic Circle to North Africa, North America and Eurasia.  Fox habitats vary widely and as such thrive in forests, mountains and grasslands and urban areas.</p>
